# BTG
A program for migrating repos from a Bitbucket Cloud workspace to a Github organization


## Usage
First, create a file called `repos.txt` with the list of repos you want to migrate:
```
repoName1
repoName2
repoName3
```

Next, put your desired configuration in a `.env` file in the same directory as the executable.
For example:
```
# .env
BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE=YOUR_WORKSPACE_HERE
# you can see your username in https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/
BITBUCKET_USER=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
BITBUCKET_TOKEN=CENSORED
# set to true to set all permissions to read when the migration starts
# (this helps prevent people accidentily writing to the old repo)
# Note this does not effect permissions inherited from the project
# You can manually revoke those permissions if you choose to do so
BITBUCKET_REVOKEOLDPERMS=false

# valid values are either ssh or https
# choose whatever method you use in the terminal
CLONE_VIA=ssh

GITHUB_ORG=YOUR_ORG_HERE
# You can use a PAT of a user, but make sure the token owner is the org
# The token MUST have write access to Administration, Contents, Issues, and Pull Requests
GITHUB_TOKEN=CENSORED

# whether overwriting existing github repo is allowed
GITHUB_OVERWRITE=false
GITHUB_DRYRUN=true
# if the bitbucket repo is private this visibility setting will be chosen
# it can be either private or internal
GITHUB_PRIVATE_VISIBILITY=internal
# runs the program before git push to github
# passes the full path to the current repo as an argument
GITHUB_RUN_PROGRAM=noop

MIGRATE_REPO_CONTENTS=true
# it's suggested to migrate repo settings if you migrate repo contents
# as migrating repo contents may reset default branch
# and migrating repo settings will reset it back
MIGRATE_REPO_SETTINGS=true
MIGRATE_OPEN_PRS=true
# MIGRATE_CLOSED_PRS not quite ready for usage yet
MIGRATE_CLOSED_PRS=false

REPO_FILE=repos.txt
```
If you have the repo cloned locally, run `go run .`

If you have downloaded the executable, run the executable.

If you get an error when pushing your git repo it is recommended to increase your git buffer:
`git config --global http.postBuffer 957286400`

If you get an error pushing because a file is more than 100MB, and you want to get rid of the file, you can use the GITHUB_RUN_PROGRAM argument. For example:
```
GITHUB_RUN_PROGRAM=/full/path/to/gobtg/scripts/removeBigObjects.sh
```

The `removeBigObjects.sh` is a script in this repo that removes any file more than 100MB. Read the script before running.
